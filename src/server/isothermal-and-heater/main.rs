/// The server code here is constructed using the thermal hydraulics 
/// library
/// The thermal_hydraulics_rs library was constructed with CIET 
/// in mind.
/// This is the compact integral effects test from the UC Berkeley 
/// Thermal Hydraulics Lab. It is a Library which contains useful 
/// traits and methods for thermal hydraulics calculations.
/// This crate has heavy reliance on units of measure (uom) released under 
/// Apache 2.0 license. So you'll need to get used to unit safe calculations
/// with uom as well.
///
///
/// This ciet-opcua-server-client-rs binary and 
/// thermal_hydraulics_rs library was initially developed for 
/// use in my PhD thesis under supervision 
/// of Professor Per F. Peterson. thermal_hydraulics_rs is 
/// a thermal hydraulics
/// library in Rust that is released under the GNU General Public License
/// v 3.0. This is partly due to the fact that some of the libraries 
/// inherit from GeN-Foam and OpenFOAM, both licensed under GNU General
/// Public License v3.0.
/// As such, the entire library and all binaries (server and client) 
/// is released under GNU GPL v3.0. It is a strong 
/// copyleft license which means you cannot use it in proprietary software 
/// unless you release the source code under GNU GPL v3.0.

///    This is a thermal hydraulics server demonstration written

///    for the Compact Integral Effects Tests (CIET) and hopefully 
///    Gen IV Reactors such as the Fluoride Salt cooled High Temperature 
///    Reactor (FHR).
